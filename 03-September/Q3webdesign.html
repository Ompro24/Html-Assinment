    <h1>WebDesign</h1>
    <p>
        Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many
         individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.
